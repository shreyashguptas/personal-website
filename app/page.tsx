          As Associate Director at the University of Arkansas, I lead analytics for 
          student-serving organizations. I'm constantly critiquing my knowledge of 
          technical skills, economics, and business then consistently learning and 
          applying. I then find time to lift weights, run, bike and eat a lot of 
          homemade sourdough pizza.
