I'm excited to introduce a new format for my blog that combines my existing Substack content with directly written posts. This integration allows me to maintain my Substack presence while also having the flexibility to write and publish content directly on my website.

## What's New?

With this new setup, you'll notice:

- **Unified Experience**: All my blog posts, whether from Substack or written directly here, appear in one seamless feed
- **Clear Source Indication**: Substack posts are clearly marked and open in a new tab
- **Consistent Styling**: The design matches the rest of my website's aesthetic
- **Fast Loading**: Thanks to Next.js and static site generation

## Technical Implementation

The blog is built with:

- Next.js for the framework
- MDX for writing posts (like this one!)
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Static Site Generation for performance

## What to Expect

Going forward, I'll be publishing content both here and on Substack. The choice of platform will depend on the content:

- **Direct Posts**: Technical deep-dives, quick updates, and web development topics
- **Substack Posts**: Longer form content, newsletters, and broader topics

## Code Example

Here's a simple code block to test the syntax highlighting:

```typescript
function formatDate(date: Date): string {
  return new Intl.DateTimeFormat('en-US', {
    month: 'long',
    year: 'numeric'
  }).format(date)
}
```

## Stay Connected

Whether you prefer reading here or on Substack, you'll have access to all my content. The blog list will always show the latest posts from both platforms, sorted by date.

Feel free to explore both platforms and engage with the content wherever you feel most comfortable!
