<p>I have done 12 different iterations of this website and this is by far the best one...</p>
    
<p>I want to spend more time coding neural nets than figuring out if my header text floats out of a div. I will leave that problem for the web devs. And also this will load way faster than any other design.</p>

            <h2>About Me</h2>
