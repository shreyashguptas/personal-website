                <p>"Shreyash Gupta has been an invaluable asset to our Data Analytics team at the University of Arkansas. One of Shreyash's most appreciated characteristics is that he does not shy away from issues, rather he is eager to solve them and looks forward to providing innovative solutions. In addition, he not only is receptive to feedback but he actively seeks out input in order to continuously improve projects. With that, while he is thorough in incorporating feedback he is an incredibly quick at doing so. I am always impressed with the speed and quality in which he is able to execute projects. Finally, Shreyash is able to strike the perfect balance of being able to take on projects independently while also contributing to the team and collaborate with other units. I cannot overstate the contributions Shreyash has made to our team."</p>
