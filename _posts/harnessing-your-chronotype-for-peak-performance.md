Are you a morning riser‚òÄÔ∏è or a night owlü¶â?

Have you ever wondered what your chronotype is and how it affects your productivity?

Let's start with the basics. We all have different preferences when it comes to working.

Some of us are morning people and thrive on waking up early and getting things done, while others are night owls who prefer to work late into the night when the world is quiet and peaceful.

Personally, I'm a morning person. I love getting up early, hitting the gym, and starting my workday feeling energized and productive.

But by the time 9:15 PM rolls around, I'm ready to hit the hayü•± and recharge for the next day.

But what if you're a night owl living in a world that operates on a morning schedule?

It can be tough to feel productive when you're groggy and sluggish in the morning, and then have to stay up late to get things done.

Unless, of course, you work at a bar or night club, in which case being a morning person would be your worst nightmare!

If you're not sure where you fall on the spectrum, take the chronotype test linked below.

It's not 100% accurate, but it's a great starting point for figuring out your natural rhythms and when you're most productive.

Once you know your chronotype, you can start to tailor your work schedule to optimize your productivity.

For example, The chart I just attached also shows the different hours of the day where I can get specific types of work done.

Early morning from 8 to 11 gives me peak focus hours to do analytical work. So in this time at work I will work on my actual project tasks that require me to do critical thinking to solve problems and build the reports. (I love building reports.)

From 1PM to 3PM I respond to emails, work with other people to help them fix any issues they may be facing and responding to slack messages.

After 4 usually I will wrap things at work but when I get home I will work on my personal stuff like this newsletter or my podcast which is where the creative work time comes along.

On the other hand, if you're a night owl, don't try to force yourself to be productive in the morning when your brain is still foggy.

Instead, take advantage of your natural energy and tackle your most challenging tasks in the late afternoon or evening.

But what about coffee? When's the best time to drink it? As a former non-coffee drinker, I was always confused about this.

But I noticed that on the days I would work out early in the morning and have a productive day, I would feel terrible by 4 or 5 PM.

And that meant I couldn't get any work done until after 9 PM, which wasn't ideal since I love to work and be productive.

That's where the chronotype test came in handy once again. According to the test, the best time for me to drink caffeine is between 9:30-11:30 AM and 1:30-3:30 PM.

I started drinking coffee only during those times, and suddenly, I stopped feeling lethargic in the middle of the day because of that 9:30-11:30 AM coffee + I was able to sleep better at night because the last time I drank coffee was at 3:30 PM, giving me six hours to get the caffeine out of my system.

Now, I know what you're thinking: "But wait, isn't caffeine bad for you?" Well, the truth is, like most things in life, caffeine is fine in moderation.

In fact, studies have shown that caffeine can actually boost productivity and help you focus. But don't overdo it, or you might end up feeling jittery and anxious.

So, in summary, figuring out your chronotype and tailoring your work schedule to optimize your productivity can have a significant impact on your success. But don't be scared to move things around and see what works for you.
