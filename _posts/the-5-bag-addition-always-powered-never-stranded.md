Have you ever traveled somewhere and forgot to pack your charging cord for your phone?

Isn't it frustrating?

Now you have to ask people you are traveling with for a charger, or worse, you have to wait till your friend's phone charges their phone and then you get it.

You may be thinking, I will just not forget to pack it before I leave.

Now I am no crazy astrologer predicting your future but what I am sure about is that you will forget it and you will hate yourself in the moment.

It's okay tho.

We are bound to forget to pack a small cable in the midst of a 100 other things we need while we are traveling.

Here is how I always have every charging cord available to me no matter what.

I got this small pouch.

It was 5$.

Now it looks simple but here is what I did different.

I bought a 2nd cable for all my devices I use.

USB C - Mac and iPad

Lightning- iPhone and Airpods

Apple Watch cable

Magnetic cable for my water bottle

Micro usb b- I don't know why but some products still ship with this port.

Alongside all the cables I have an extra wall brick + a Magsafe power bank for the iPhone.

I keep all of it in my pouch organized.

And the pouch stays in my bag 24/7.

Now anytime I am traveling, I put all my tech into my bag and go.

I don't have to think about packing any cables.

Everything is just ready to go.

This is not a hack or smart trick.

It is like automating a thing we tend to forget a lot.

Now the the cables will differ for you but you get the point.
