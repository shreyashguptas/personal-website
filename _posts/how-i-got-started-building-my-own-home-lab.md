I've gone from not knowing the difference between Linux distributions to running a lightweight Kubernetes (K3S) cluster and deploying web applications — and while I'm still new to this field, the growth has been undeniable.

About 10 months ago, I decided to build hardware infrastructure for my projects. The goal? To use the hardware I had on hand to run local AI chat models. Looking back, that decision kickstarted a journey packed with problem-solving, hands-on learning, and a growing sense of confidence.

It all began with an old HP laptop. Back then, I didn't even know what the command "ls" did. I installed Ubuntu, figuring out how to navigate Linux step by step. My goal was simple: understand the command line. That old laptop became my home server, running Python code all day, every day. Since my personal MacBook had to come with me to classes, frequently disconnecting from the internet, the HP laptop filled that gap perfectly.

Then came a Raspberry Pi 2. Small but capable, it became my sandbox for experimenting with Linux distributions and running small projects. Every experiment taught me something new, and every small win built my confidence. I even set up a camera on it to watch my office door — a simple but practical solution, since my back faces the door when I am sitting on my desk and I didn't want to be caught off guard.

The next big milestone was building a high-end PC tower. This wasn't just any PC — it became my personal server. We set it up to function as a database and a central hub for storing project data. It also had the horsepower to run machine learning algorithms. This was where I learned how to setup a Linux environment from the ground up — not just installing it, but configuring it to handle larger, more complex workflows. This experience taught me how to approach infrastructure with purpose and precision.

With these foundational skills in place, I'm now tackling my most ambitious project yet: building a Raspberry Pi Kubernetes cluster. My vision for this cluster is clear. I'm creating a permanent NAS (network-attached storage) system, a backend to run algorithms, and a local database to store project data. It's the next big challenge, but I've come to see challenges as opportunities to sharpen my skills.

I do get asked "Why not just use the cloud?" Honestly, I do use cloud services for some of my applications when it makes sense to do so. But for many of my projects, building from scratch serves a deeper purpose. First, it's incredibly rewarding. Every problem solved reveals new problems, and tackling them builds resilience and confidence. Second, even though I'm not doing this for career growth, the skills I'm developing have real value. Building infrastructure from scratch teaches principles that apply across fields, and those skills stick with you.

It's wild to think I've gone from struggling to understand "ls" to running a K3S cluster. I'm still new to this, but I'm no longer stuck at square one. This journey hasn't been linear — it's been a series of small wins and steady progress. Every project builds on the last, and with each step, I've learned more than I ever expected.

If you're on a similar path, keep at it. Each "aha" moment compounds over time, and before you know it, you'll be building systems you once thought were out of reach.
