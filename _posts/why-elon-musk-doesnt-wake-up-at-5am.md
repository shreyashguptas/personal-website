First things first, let's address the elephant in the room: waking up at 5AM.

Now, I don't know about you, but the only time I want to be up at 5AM is if there's a puppy who needs to be walked or a freshly baked pie waiting for me in the kitchen.

But hey, maybe that's just me.

If you've ever googled "morning habits of successful people," you'll find tons of tips like

Ditching the alarm clock

Not going straight for coffee

Eliminating decision-making tasks

But is there a one-size-fits-all solution to success?

Don't get me wrong, there's nothing wrong with having a routine.

In fact, it can be incredibly helpful in getting things done and feeling accomplished.

But the thing is, not every routine works for everyone. Not even Elon Musk wakes up at 5AM. Have you not seen the man tweet at 2:41AM.

Now, I'm not saying that waking up early is bad. It just might not work for everyone.

The key is to find what works best for you. And to do that, you need to take a step back and analyze your routine.

Let me give you an example. Say you feel tired and unmotivated at work every morning. Instead of chugging another cup of coffee, do a 'Root-Cause Analysis'. Yes, it sounds fancy and something your boss wants, but it's a simple activity.

Root Cause Analysis:

Picture this: It's 11 AM, and you're already yawning your way through your workday. The day has barely started, and you're feeling like you could doze off right at your desk.

Why is this happening? Let's take a closer look.

First, we need to ask ourselves

"Why am I feeling tired?"

Well, it turns out that I not getting enough sleep, and I am waking up early for work.

Why am I sleeping so late?

Ah, last night I was watching a movie on Netflix but on other days I am on my phone scrolling.

Why was watching a movie late at night more important than getting enough sleep?

Well, that's the only time I get for myself.

Why are you not able to find more time for your self out of 24 hours?

I just do things one after another without really planning out my work/school schedule.

Aha! We've discovered the root cause of feeling tired at work - not having a clear plan for the day and not knowing when to do what.

But fear not, for there is a simple solution.

Just create a schedule for your day, block off time for work, classes, and anything else you need to get done, and you'll find that there are some gaps in your schedule where you can catch a break and do the things you love.

Like watching a movie on Netflix, for example.

With a little planning and foresight, you can get rid of those mid-day yawns and power through your workday/classes like a champ.

So, there you have it - a simple root cause analysis to help you identify the underlying issues that might be affecting your productivity. Give it a try, and you'll be amazed at how quickly you can turn things around.

Of course, there are times when you just have to start a new routine and adjust on the go.

But other times, it's important to dig deeper and ask yourself "Why" before jumping on a new routine.

And there you have it! Productivity and self-improvement don't have to be one-size-fits-all.
