Ever had a week where everything seems to go wrong?

Well, my last seven days have been just that.

Stomach poisoning, 24 hours of traveling, and then COVID hit me like a ton of bricks. But, I'm happy to report that I'm finally on the road to recovery.

So, whether you're feeling down or just looking for a little inspiration, I hope you'll find something of value in this week's newsletter.

The stomach poisoning was funny because me and my parents tried this new place the night before I had to fly back to the US. I ordered my dish but didn't think that was enough to satisfy my taste buds so had to order another plate.

Lol. It was great for an hour but after it started to burn like crazy.

I thought it was nothing and just my stomach trying to digest this delicious food. Spoiler alert, NAAH. It gave me freaking food poisoning. I slept probably like 40 mins thought the night. I had to keep watching movies on my iPad to keep myself distracted.

That shit was painful. ðŸ˜“

Covid was an unexpected one. I didn't know it was still going around.

Heck I haven't even worn a mask in like 1.5 years at this point I guess.

I came back home and went on a nice 3 mile run with my roommate. Went to sleep a little early because I was still jet lagged and guess what, I woke up with a high fever.

Gawd dammit. Who would have thought. From high fever to coughing, sore throat, sinuses running, eye hurting, muscle aches, and probably more that I can't even remember.

And the worst part is, I gave this to my girlfriend too so now we have been partners in crime for the last 5 days watching every TV show and movie that we had left unfinished.

When life gives you lemons, make lemonade, they say. But when life gives you a fever, sore throat, and a runny nose, what do you do?

You binge-watch your favorite TV shows and movies! Trust me, I'm an expert at this.

Whenever I get sick, I take it as a sign from the universe to park myself on the bed and watch Netflix/Youtube all day long.

I mean, what's the point of being productive when your body is already working overtime fighting off those pesky viruses? So, go ahead, take a sick day, grab some popcorn, and settle in for a day of guilt-free binge-watching.

Your immune system will thank you later!

Now that I feel recovered and am totally over watching TV, I am in total productivity mood and that is why you are reading this newsletter.

Happy weekend and stay productive, unless you are sick.
