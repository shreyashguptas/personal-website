So, it's been about a year since I seriously started learning Python. Can you believe it? I remember back in ninth grade when my friends tried to show me how to print a simple "Hello World" in Python. Man, it was the hardest thing for my mind to grasp. I kept wondering, "Why am I even doing this?"

Over the years, I've tried different ways and techniques to learn Python, but nothing really stuck. That is, until I started my master's program last year. We had this introduction course in Python, and let me tell you, it was a game-changer.

This program was like a catalyst, you know? I had to do project after project using code, and that really allowed me to get my hands dirty in this field. In just the last year, I've done so much with Python - data cleaning, visualization, and a bunch of reporting stuff. It's crazy!

But that's not all. I've also learned so many different technical tools. Linux distributions, web development, HTML and CSS for my personal website... the list goes on. I never thought I'd be doing all this in just one year.

I'm honestly excited to see how far I've come in such a short time. It's like, wow, look at all this growth! And I can't help but wonder how much further I'll be able to go.

You know what's really cool? The field of AI is growing so rapidly, and it's made learning technical skills so much faster and easier. I think without AI, I wouldn't have come this far in such a short time. Maybe I would've lost interest altogether.

So here's to a whole year of developing cool stuff, and hopefully many more years to come! Who knows what I'll be coding up next?
