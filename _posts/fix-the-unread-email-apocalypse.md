There are two types of people: those whose email inbox is always empty, and those whose inbox always has millions of unopened emails. My guess is that you are the one with a million unopened emails, and this newsletter is just for you. If you are on the other end of the spectrum and never have any unread emails, close this email, and I will see you next week!

This is my Inbox as I type this newsletter. And you will find out why its not exactly Inbox Zero.

Why should you care about your million unread inbox? The next time you get an important email offering you a job or a scholarship asking you for documents so they can give you money, you won't see it. It will be like finding a needle in a haystack. I don't know the saying, but you know what I mean.

How do you get to an 'Inbox Zero' state, you ask? I'm glad you asked.

Step 1: Open your email.

Step 2: Click 'Select All.'

Step 3: Click 'Mark as Read.'

No, we are not going through all of your previous emails. If they were important, you would have opened them, but you didn't. So let's start with a clean slate here.

If you need to find something later, then just use the search feature, and you will find any email you want to look for.

If you have multiple email apps you use on your phone, like Gmail, Outlook, etc., first log in to all of your emails, and I mean all of them, into ONE APP ONLY. I use Outlook for all of my 11 email accounts.

Now, here is what I want you to do with any new email that comes in:

Marketing email: You get a marketing email, I want you to scroll to the bottom and click 'Unsubscribe.' I want you to do it every time you receive one of those damn marketing emails that you don't ever want to see again.

Emails you need to respond to: Mark these emails as 'Unread' and come back to them in your Focus time.

Emails that you need to take action on: As soon as you get these emails, I want you to put the task you need to perform in your Task Management app. If you don't have a task management system, then go read my newsletter called "Let's Get Whackin'! How to Conquer Your To-Do List Once and For All"

Any other email you get, you mark it as read every time.

I follow this exact rule, and I never miss any important email about anything, and that is my superpower.
