Have you ever used AI chat tools to not get fired? Well I have and you can learn something from me today.

There is a good chance that you will skip reading the newsletter if it was all written by ChatGPT. Why is that? My simple answer is, people want to buy from people and here I am selling some information (for free) and you would not want to read something written by a machine. Well if ChatGPT had more grammatical errors and poor writing skills like me, then it may have looked like I wrote it.

So what is the point of this newsletter? It's simple.

Most of us have to write professional sounding emails or messages for job applications, email to your boss or reaching out to a client. For decades people have been making fun of corporate people sounding robotic after a point. What happens to people who are not robotic and professional? Well they are not taken seriously in those places.

Here is what I do and would recommend you do.

Next time you have to send an email to a work colleague who has not been doing their work which has put you in a bad mood and your email sounds something like-

"Dear [insert work colleague name]

Please could you get me the sales report for the last quarter by the end of today so I can get my god damn visualization report done for the boss. They have been after my life to complete this and you are not taking this seriously at all.

Kind Regards,

Shreyash Gupta"

Well this may not go well if I send it. But what if I used AI to help me out.

Watch this

Prompt

"Could you please make this email I am sending to a work colleague sound more professional."

This is what ChatGPT has to say about it

Lets goo!!! This is what we need AI for. Those bad days when you just can not frame that sentence for these professional settings.

So if you are in a corporate job or a professional setting where writing grammatically error-free content is appreciated, then go ahead and use AI. However, every time you use it, read it back and see how it differs from what you may have written, and get better.

Use AI as a supplement to your own abilities, you'll find that they can actually help you be more productive and efficient.
