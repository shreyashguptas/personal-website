Most people wait for the perfect moment to start a new habit. They imagine some magical Monday or New Year's Day when everything will align. But habits rarely start that way.

My journey with Duolingo began unexpectedly. My wife was learning Hindi, my native language, and during one of our conversations, we realized something interesting: knowing a unique third language could be our secret code. She already knew German from living there. I knew Hindi and English. What if we learned a language that none of our friends or family spoke?

The idea was simple yet captivating. We could have private conversations in plain sight. This small spark of curiosity turned into action - not on a Monday, not on New Year's, but on a random evening when I downloaded Duolingo.

I've done one lesson every night before bed for 100 days now. Through international trips, time zones changes, and exhausting workdays, I haven't missed a day. Not because I'm particularly disciplined - each lesson takes just a few minutes - but because I found genuine value in it.

What's fascinating isn't the language learning itself, but the unexpected ways it has shaped my life. The nightly lesson has become a signal to my body that it's time to sleep. It's transformed from a language-learning app into a bedtime ritual.

The habit has created surprising social connections too. At work, someone notices the Duolingo widget on my phone. At family gatherings, others recognize the distinctive correct-answer chime while I'm quietly doing a lesson. These small moments create instant bonds with fellow language learners.

Then there are the unexpected moments of recognition. I'll be at an airport and suddenly realize I understand parts of a German announcement. Or I'll catch words in German songs while driving. These small victories make the learning process feel real and tangible.

Duolingo has also changed my relationship with my phone. Instead of mindless scrolling, I now have pockets of focused learning. It's a small but meaningful shift in how I use technology.

The irony is that I started this without any practical goal. I have no plans to live in Germany. I might visit someday, but that's not the point. The value lies in the daily practice, the conversations it sparks, and the small ways it has enriched my routine.

I shall report back in 1000 days and see if I learned something new. Maybe I am fluent in German by then.
