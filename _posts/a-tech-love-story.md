For 11 years, I've been watching all kinds of tech videos. Imagine Apple's coolest shows, exciting battles between Android and iOS, creative desk setups, and super cool app arrangements. All these videos boosted my love for tech like watering a plant!

Guess what? This was my ticket to an iPhone adventure!

A few weeks go by and I can not find either one of two earphones. All frustrated that I have to do to class with no music I walked straight to the Tech store and bought myself a pair of the 1st gen Airpods.

Apple's stuff just fits together like magic, and I loved it.

A year goes by and I have a pile of books and notebooks. As an international student I can not carry these with me everywhere. I need a solution.

In comes the iPad. I always wanted one and this was the perfect time so I can take notes, have pdf of books and watch content.

Back when I was in school, I was a big Android fan. But when I came to the U.S. in 2018, my Android phone got cursed in just 8 days. Was it bad luck or iPhone users conspiring against my green bubble texts? Nobody really knows.

I went from having no Apple products to having a classic college student setup.

Now I had gotten the taste of the Apple Ecosystem.

Soon enough I saved up for a MacBook, not the fastest, but it kickstarted my school work. Then I got into fitness and got an Apple Watch â€“ a buddy for staying healthy. Also got a HomePod that turned my room into a music zone!

There is a positive correlation between the improvements that came in my life with the amount of Apple products I bought. Now is this causation? Maybe/Maybe not. But the point is I found something that seems to work for me.

Fast forward to now, my desk's rocking with 2 big screens and a powerful MacBook Pro M1. I use an iPad for school and fun, my original HomePod blasts Drake songs, top of the line Logitech keyboard and mouse with a Benq light bar, and for gaming, I've got a PS5 for some Call of Duty with friends.

My motive with this story is to share how I found tech that works for the stuff I do and I want you to be on a constant hunt for the next thing that will positively benefit your personal + professional life. Be happy with what you have but never satisfied.
